3.Demo and Instruction for Use

*Instructions to run on data
For D20130704_Select_ROI.m:
(i)First download demo data to the same folder with the codes.
(ii)Start MATLAB, and run "D20130704_Select_ROI.m".
(iii) When asked the number of images, enter the number of the image you want to analyze, for our demo data, please enter "512". 
(iv) Choose a type of image you are analyzing. For example, "T" for forward THG image.
(v) The figure you select will pop out. Then, manually create a ROI on the figure.
When you are done, right click the mouse and select "Create Mask".
(vi) If you want to continue creating more ROI or delete the ROI you just created, please enter "A" or "D", respectively.
(vii) If you confirm the ROI selection, press "enter" to continue the analysis process.

For other codes:
(i) D20130704_ErrorDiscussion_20131028_20190308.m", you will get Figure 2 (e).
(ii) Run "D20130704_Statistics_of_ROI_20190308.m", you will get Figure 2 (g), and a .tif image of Mean Saturation Rate versus TPF(pixel value).
(iii) Run "D20130704_PolyRegression_20131028_20190308.m", you will get Figure 2 (h) and (i).

*Expected output: As indicated in Instruction

*Expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer
-->  It takes less than 1 minutes for each image analyzed.
